# Graduate Project ([Techcareer.net](www.techcareer.net) Android Bootcamp)

As a bootcamp graduation project, I created a food ordering application with the application name Food Shop.

* The data is obtained from ready-made web services on the internet.

## Technologies I use in the application:

* MVVM
* Databinding
* Navigation Component
* Retrofit
* Firebase

## Here's what the app can do:

* Authentication
* Listing the Meals
* Meal Detail Screen
* Ability to Select Pieces in Detail
* Adding the Meal with the Selected Quantity to the Basket
* Viewing the Meals in the Basket
* Deleting Food from the Basket

***

## Authentication

I used firebase database as authentication so each user can keep their cart information individually.

You can do the deletion by holding the food you want to delete and swiping it to the left.
